Documented steps for converting thermal videos. See note “Steps for converting thermal videos”
 -Carter’s code for using the FLIR Science File SDK is unusable in its current form. To finish this document (and progress on this project I need to either wait for Carter to get back and help me decipher the magic numbers in his code (June 11 he says) , try to do conversions using FLIRs thermal studio tool, or figure out Carters process independently, which would takes days at least.
