# Batch Processing in Thermal Studio Pro
#lab-notebook
#thermal-video
#balsa

Used thermal studio pro demo mode to do video conversion

Batch processing with
1. Clear spotometers
2. Scale minimum -> 20C
3. Scale Maximum -> 28C
4. Palette -> lava
5. Isotherm -> Above, 84F, green
6. Clear text annotations
7. Clear all measurements
8. Create AVI -> 30 FPS, 99 quality

Looks good, remaining issues:

Remove legends, watermark

2.6.21 Addendum
Clearing “Overlay enabled” appears to remove all layers, INCLUDING the legends and the watermark. As far as I can tell this is a hack that basically allows use of pro features in the demo.
